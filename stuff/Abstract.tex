One of the challenges of Federated learning is finding the right balance in communication frequency: too infrequent communications lead to worse convergence, while too frequent ones require significant overhead (time for data transmission and network load). 
\cite{Woodworth} proved that for the case where the objective function is quadratic, the communication frequency does not affect the upper bound on the convergence rate.
In this work, we focus on generalizing these results, providing an analysis in the case where the objective function is the sum of a quadratic function and an arbitrary remainder.

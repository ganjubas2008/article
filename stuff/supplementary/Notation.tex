To begin with, let us introduce useful contractions. 
By the capital Latin letters \( F, \ Q, \ R \) we will denote functions. 
Corresponding stochastic gradients will be represented by the bold Gothic lowercase Latin letters \( \mc{g}, \ \mc{q}, \ \mc{r} \), and the straight lowercase Latin letters \( g, \ q, \ r \) will denote the expectations of the gradients.

A bar above the letter (i.e., \( \bar{g} \)) will indicate that we take the average of this value among all devices.

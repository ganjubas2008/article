Let's look at the loss function; on all devices it is equal to a certain $F$.

Consider the problem of minimizing objective function \( F: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \), i.e. finding such $x_*$, that
\[
F(x_*) = \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} F(x)
\]


We will denote its stochastic gradients as $\nabla F(x, z)$, where $z$ is sampled from some distribution $\mathcal{D}$ 

Also we will consider that $\nabla F(x, z)$ is an unbiased estimate of $\E_{z \sim \mathcal{D}} [\nabla F(x, z)]$, i.e.
\[
\nabla F(x) = \E_{z \sim \mathcal{D}} [\nabla F(x, z)]
\]

Things get more interesting when we consider expressing $\E[\|\bar{x}_{t+1} - x_*\|^2]$ in terms of $\E[\|\bar{x}_{t} - x_*\|^2]$ instead of solving a recurrent relation and analyzing $\E[\|\bar{x}_T - x_*\|^2]$.

\vspace{10pt}

As can be observed from \eqref{eq:interesting}, under the assumptons of Theorem~\ref{th:th_1}, we have:
\begin{align}
    \E \|\bar{x}_{t+1}-x_*\|^2
    &\leq
    (1 - \gamma \mu) \E \|\bar{x}_t - x_*\|^2 
    + \frac{\gamma^2 \sigma^2}{M}
    + 2 \varepsilon \gamma L (H-1) \gamma^2 \sigma^2 \label{eq:recurrent}
\end{align}

Здесь хочется больше услышать про формальную сторону вопроса, типа эпсилон выбираем оптимально

Considering $\varepsilon$ as a function of $x$, we can observe that for functions with a Lipschitz Hessian, we know that the decay rate of $\varepsilon$ is fast. The following graphs illustrate the decay rate of $\varepsilon$ for some functions:

In point (b), by LogLoss with $l_2$ regularization, we mean 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:logloss}
    y = -\ln\left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \right) + 0.03 x^2
\end{equation}

And in point (c), we analyze a well-known function that yields lower bound estimates for Local SGD \citep{LowerBound}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:piecewise}
    \mathcal{F}(x) = \begin{cases} 
      x^2 / 5 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
      x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Here, we notice that for functions (a) and (b), $\varepsilon$ decreases rapidly because they satisfy the Lipschitz Hessian assumption, the proof of this fact can be found in Lemma \ref{lem:decay_eps}. Due to the decay of $\varepsilon$ we can increase number of local steps $H$ or reduce number of communcations $R$, which means enhancing communcation complexity.

However, for function (c), $\varepsilon$ remains constant in any neighborhood of its optimum. This may provide additional insight into why $\mathcal{F}$ yields lower bounds for Local SGD.

From this example, we can observe that equation~\ref{eq:recurrent} provides valuable insights into the convergence rate for different types of functions. However, abandoning the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian means that we cannot estimate the decay rate of $\varepsilon$. Therefore, conducting a meaningful asymptotic analysis while maintaining generality seems impossible.

Thus, our aim is to present our findings within a broader scope, elucidating the physical interpretation of the convergence rate.

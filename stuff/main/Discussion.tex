Things get more interesting in perspective of expressing $\E[\norm{\bar{x}_{t+1} - x_*}^2]$ through $\E[\norm{\bar{x}_{t} - x_*}^2]$ instead of solving recurrent relation and analyzing $\E[\norm{\bar{x}_T - x_*}^2]$. 

%We'll go deeper into the strongly convex case because it's more intuitive.

As can be observed from~\ref{lem:main}:
\begin{align}
     \E \norm{\bar{x}_{t+1}-x_*}^2
    &\leq
    (1 - \gamma \mu) \E \norm{\bar{x}_t - x_*}^2 
    + \frac{\gamma^2 \sigma^2}{M}
    + 10 \varepsilon \gamma L (H-1) \gamma^2 \sigma^2 \label{eq:recurrent}
\end{align}

Considering $\varepsilon$ as a function of $x$, we can say that for the functions with Lipschitz Hessian we know that the decay rate of $\varepsilon$ is fast. Following graphs illustrate decay rate of $\varepsilon$ for some functions:

\input{graphs/EpsGraphs}
\\

In point (b) by LogLoss we mean 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:logloss}
    y = -\ln\left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \right) + 0.03 {x^2}
\end{equation}

And in point (c) we analyze well-known function that yields lower bound estimates for Local SGD \citep{LowerBound}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:piecewise}
    \mathcal{F}(x) = \begin{cases} 
      x^2 / 5 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
      x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Here we can notice that for functions (a) and (b) $\varepsilon$ decreases rapidly (because they satisfy Lipschitz Hessian assumption), and for function (c) it remains constant. This may be considered as some additional insight into why 
$\mathcal{F}$ yields lower bound for Local SGD.

From this example we can observe that equation~\ref{eq:recurrent} provides valuable insights into convergence rate for different types of functions. However, abandoning the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian means that we cannot estimate the decay rate of epsilon. Therefore conducting a meaningful asymptotic analysis while maintaining generality seems impossible.

Thus our aim is to present our findings within a broader scope, elucidating the physical interpretation of the convergence rate.
